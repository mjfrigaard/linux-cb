This could be an applications, library, utility, or their dependencies. \n\n## Package managers\n\nIn the Linux ecosystem, `apt`, `yum`, and `dnf` are **package managers**. These tools are responsible for installing and managing software packages, such as installing, updating, and removing software, as well as resolving package dependencies.\n\n### `apt`\n\n`apt` (Advanced Package Tool)is used on **Debian-based distributions** like Ubuntu, Debian, etc. `apt` installs packages from `.deb` files, which are precompiled software packages.\n\n#### Example usage\n\n  -   Install a package:   \n \n      ```sh\n      sudo apt install <package_name>\n      ```\n      \n  -   Update a package:   \n \n      ```sh\n      sudo apt update\n      ```\n      \n  -   Upgrade installed packages: \n  \n      ```sh\n      sudo apt upgrade\n      ```\n\n### `yum`\n\n`yum` (Yellowdog Updater, Modified) is used on **older Red Hat-based distributions** like CentOS 7, RHEL 7, and Fedora. yum installs packages from `.rpm` files, which are precompiled software packages.\n\n\n#### Example usage\n\n  -   Install a package:    \n  \n      ```sh\n      sudo yum install <package_name>\n      ```\n\n  -   Update all packages: \n  \n      ```sh\n      sudo yum update\n      ```\n      \n  -   Remove a package: \n  \n      ```sh\n      sudo yum remove <package_name>\n      ```\n\n### `dnf`\n\n`dnf` (Dandified YUM) is the **next-generation version of `yum`** and the default package manager for **RHEL 8+, CentOS 8+, and Fedora**.\n\n   - More efficient and faster than `yum`, with better dependency management.\n   \n#### Example usage\n\n  -   Install a package: \n  \n      ```sh\n      sudo dnf install <package_name>\n      ```\n  \n  -   Update all packages: \n  \n      ```sh\n      sudo dnf update\n      ```\n\n  -   Remove a package: \n\n      ```sh\n      sudo dnf remove <package_name>\n      ```\n\n\n## Recap\n\nThe `apt`, `yum`, and `dnf` **package managers** install:\n\n1. **Software packages**: Precompiled binaries or scripts, such as applications, libraries, and utilities.\n\n2. **Dependencies**: Additional packages required for the primary software to function correctly.\n\n3. **Updates**: Security patches and newer versions of existing software.\n\nThese package managers fetch packages from their respective repositories, which are online or local directories containing approved and signed software packages.",
